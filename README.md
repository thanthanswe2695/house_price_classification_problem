House price prediction by using classification models

In house price dataset, it has 16 features among 15 features are independent variables and sale_price feature is considered for dependent variable.However, sale_price variable is a float data type and I would like to consider categeorical data by using one hot and lable encoding method in data preparation step. I would like to solve classification problem by changing dependent varaible data type.
